# Software-developer-salary-prediction
Developing a Machine Learning model to predict software developer salaries, then creating a web app to using Streamlit to explore the dataset and make predictions.

# About this project.
This project is all about cleaning the software developer salary dataset, from Stack overflow, for the year 2020, applying various machine learning models to the data (Mainly regression) to make the predictions about the salaries of software developers, and finally using Streamlit to build a web app to enable a user explore the dataset and make predictions of developer salaries.
